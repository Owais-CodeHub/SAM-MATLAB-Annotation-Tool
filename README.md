## 🔍 Overview

**SAM-MATLAB-Annotation-Tool** is a lightweight yet powerful image annotation application built entirely in MATLAB using the Segment Anything Model (SAM).  
It is designed for **image-by-image annotation**, allowing users to interactively segment objects, refine results, and export annotations in formats ready for downstream **computer vision and deep learning workflows**.

The tool focuses on:
- Simplicity
- Interactivity
- High-quality masks without model training
